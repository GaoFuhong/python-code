The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
我用自负和傲慢玩着爱情的游戏
And every flame I lit too quickly, quickly died
所有我点燃的火焰都熄灭得太快
The friends I made all somehow seemed to slip away
所有我交的朋友似乎都不知不觉地离开了
And only now I'm left alone to end the play, yeah
只剩我一个人在台上来结束这场闹剧
Oh, yesterday when I was young
噢 昨日当我年少轻狂
So many, many songs were waiting to be sung
有那么那么多甜美的曲儿等我歌唱
So many wild pleasures lay in store for me
有那么多肆意的快乐等我享受
And so much pain my eyes refused to see
还有那么多痛苦 我的双眼却视而不见
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung
我有太多歌曲永远不会被唱起
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue
我尝到了舌尖泪水的苦涩滋味
The time has come for me to pay for yesterday
终于到了付出代价的时间 为了昨日
When I was young
当我年少轻狂
